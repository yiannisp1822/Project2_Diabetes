# Code Demonstration Instructions

After cloning the repository, before running the code, ensure that your folder and file structure **at minimum** looks like the following:

```
├── Resources/
├──── diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
├── diabetes-prediction-modeling.ipynb
```

You will need:
- A directory called **"Resources/"** to exactly match the input data from the repository
- The **"diabetes-prediction-modeling.ipynb"** notebook file to run the analysis 

The raw datasets must be inside the **"Resources/** folder.

Please run the **"diabetes-prediction-modeling.ipynb"** file to run the analysis. The notebook has the file paths matching the folder structure found in the repository.  

Please note you must have the following python libraries installed before running this code:

1. pandas 
    - Needed for general data frame management
2.
