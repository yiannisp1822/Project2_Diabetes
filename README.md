# Project2_Diabetes

# WIP

## Work so far completed as of Week 1 for Project 2

1. Found Datasets
2. EDA on all three datasets
3. Decision to use BRFSS2015_5050 split dataset
4. Further EDA and data cleaning of chosen dataset
5. Performed preliminary machine learning models on the dataset

## TODO

- Begin fine-tuning models and seeing where we can further clean or explore the data
- Finalize a model that gets the best accuracy for classification of diabetes
- Write Final writeup in Github Readme and in a presentation

## For the datasets

### diabetes.csv
Our original dataset that we looked at, TA commented as small, not going to use

### diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv
The second dataset we found. It is larger, but uncited, and needed a great deal of encoding, not used

### diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
Third Dataset I found, much larger, almost same features, 0 indicates no diabetes, 1 indicates prediabetes or diabetic, unbalanced

### diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
Third Dataset I found along with the previous, much larger, almost same features, 0 indicates no diabetes, 1 indicates prediabetes, 2 indicates diabetic, unbalanced

### diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
Third Dataset I found along with the previous two, much larger, almost same features, 0 indicates no diabetes, 1 indicates prediabetes or diabetic, balanced

We Decided to go with the 5050 BRFSS2015 Dataset to do this analysis

## Code

The code is ran through **diabetes-prediction-modeling-FINAL.ipynb**.
