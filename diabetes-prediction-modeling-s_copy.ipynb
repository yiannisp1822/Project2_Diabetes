    "We found our data on Kaggle at the following [link, found by Alex Teboul](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data). This data set was obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. It is an annual survey that has been collected since 1984 and the features are either questions asked of participants or variables calculated based on their responses. We will use this dataset to create a machine learning model that predicts based on the given data, whether a person has diabetes or does not"
